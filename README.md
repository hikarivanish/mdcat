# MDCAT
-------

very simple blog app.(sorry for my poor english)

## STATIC MARKDOWN BLOG

compared to jekyll,

* static
* written in markdown
* specific page
* code highlight
* you can customize the style

differences

* no need for build( no need for installing ruby or something else),edit and upload ,so simple!
* mdcat doesn't support some advanced feature 

## conventions
